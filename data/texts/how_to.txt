How-to: To make this web app work, some files need to be uploaded. These are 1) a vector file of the points to be analysed (e.g., sites, materials) and 2) a spatial polygon file of the research area. Vector files should be in one of the following formats: .cpg, .dbf, .prj, .qmd, .shp, and .shx. Furthermore, the number of Monte Carlo simulations, the number of Robustness Scenarios, and the Quantile need to be specified. For the Monte Carlo simulations, we recommended values between 1000 and 5000. For the Robustness Scenarios, the value should be between 100 and 3000. Please note that these values are a recommendation based on the standard computational power of a laptop or PC and the possibilities of this web app. Therefore, if you would like to increase the values and have a good performance, we recommend checking the source code on Niels Aalund Krogsgaardâ€™s GitHub (link below) and modifying it to your needs. Also, please consider that the higher the values you choose for your analysis, the longer the waiting time to get a result (in some cases, it can take several hours). In the Quantile dropdown menu, you will be presented with the option of choosing one or several quantiles. We recommend that you play with the options, but if you are looking for a comprehensive comparison of the results, choose all available quantile options.
