Based on the paper by Herrera Malatesta and de Valeriola (2024), this web app seeks to allow interested researchers, specialized and non-specialized in computational archaeology, to reproduce the paperâ€™s results and, most importantly, to be able to quantify the uncertainty on their own spatial dataset. Following the aim of the paper of contributing to the growing literature on data incompleteness and uncertainty quantification in archaeology this web app is the direct expression of formalizing practices and procedures into a framework.
Robusta aims to help colleagues who desire to better understand their models by quantifying their uncertainties. The framework we propose here focuses on assessing the robustness and uncertainties of the conclusions drawn from applying point pattern analysis to, mostly, non-systematic regional data in archaeology. To achieve this aim, we have articulated the discussion on the reconstruction of past landscapes using computational methods around three key aspects: the use of point pattern analysis (PPA) in archaeology, the quantification of uncertainties, and the consideration of robustness.
The framework that will be presented is designed to aid archaeologists -working with datasets that are known to contain sources of uncertainty- to be able to apply spatial statistical methods and achieve a higher understanding of the uncertainties of the resulting models.
