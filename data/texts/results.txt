The results will provide two figures that can be downloaded as a PDF. The figure of the first comparison tool will present the percentages of sites that are kept in each robustness scenarios against the percentage of robustness scenarios in which the conclusion is similar to the observable. This figure provides a direct percentage of the probability that, by extracting a particulresultsar percentage of the dataset, the results of the robustness scenario will be similar to the ‘observable.’ The second comparison tool goes deeper in the understanding of the patterns and provide an insight of what can be further observed from the pattern in term of its clustering.
At this point, it is important to clarify that the web app is only analyzing the statistically significant  patterns on the PCF, and not the regular ones. Again, if an analysis would like to include this in their analysis, they need to modify the source code used for this web app.
