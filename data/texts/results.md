The processing will produce 3 tabs: 
* PCF based on 100% of sites
* Robustness PCF, with additional tabs for the different subgroups
* Comparison Tools

Read more about these in the **"Methods"** tab. 

NOTE: When downloading the results, only five robustness scenarios are downloaded and not all of the selected ones. 
This is because the web app is just for testing, and users are encouraged to use the local version of the app that can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/robusta_webapp).
