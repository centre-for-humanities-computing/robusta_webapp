Based on the paper by [Herrera Malatesta and de Valeriola (2024)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307743), 
this web app allows interested researchers in computational archaeology to reproduce the paperâ€™s results and quantify the uncertainty on their own spatial datasets. 

In essence, Robusta aims to help colleagues who desire to better understand their models by quantifying their uncertainties. 
For an in-depth description of the framework, see the tab **"Methods"**.

Robusta exists both as an interactive web app and as an open-source tool that can be downloaded and run locally. The web app is primarily meant as a demo, and can become unstable when running bigger computations.

We therefore recommend that users download the app if they want to play around with their own datasets and larger numbers of simulations, and only use the test dataset and a low number of simulations when using the web app. <br>
