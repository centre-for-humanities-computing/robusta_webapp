Based on the paper by [Herrera Malatesta and de Valeriola (2024)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307743), 
this web app allows interested researchers in computational archaeology to reproduce the paperâ€™s results and quantify the uncertainty on their own spatial datasets. 


In essence, Robusta aims to help colleagues who desire to better understand their models by quantifying their uncertainties. 
For an in-depth description of the framework, see the tab **"Methods"**.
