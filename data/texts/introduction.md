Based on the paper by [Herrera Malatesta and de Valeriola (2024)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307743), 
this web app allows interested researchers in computational archaeology to reproduce the paperâ€™s results and quantify the uncertainty on their own spatial datasets. 

The framework we propose here focuses on assessing the robustness and uncertainties of conclusions drawn from applying point pattern analysis to, mostly, 
non-systematic regional data in archaeology. 
To achieve this, we have articulated the discussion on the reconstruction of past landscapes using computational methods around three key aspects: 
1) the use of point pattern analysis (PPA) in archaeology
2) the quantification of uncertainties
3) the consideration of robustness.

The framework that will be presented is designed to aid archaeologists working with datasets that are known to contain sources of uncertainty in applying
spatial statistical methods and achieve a higher understanding of the uncertainties of the resulting models.

In essence, Robusta aims to help colleagues who desire to better understand their models by quantifying their uncertainties. 
For an in-depth description of the framework, see the tab **"Methods"**.
